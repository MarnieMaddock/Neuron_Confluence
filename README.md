Instructions
- Take images on Incucyte (I did 25 images per 24well)	
- Make sure each image name is unique (the automatic format of well_picturenumber_yearmonthday is perfect)
- Save all images to a folder as a TIFF
- Run macro :)
- This determines the confluency of every image. The %Area column is the confluence % of that image. To get an average confluency per well, use excel/R script)

Instructions
	1. Take images on Incucyte (I did 25 images per 24well)
	
	2. Make sure each image name is unique (the automatic format of well_picturenumber_yearmonthday is perfect)
	
	3. Save all images to a folder as a TIFF
	
	4. Run macro :)
	
	5. This determines the confluency of every image. To get an average confluency per well, use excel/R script)
